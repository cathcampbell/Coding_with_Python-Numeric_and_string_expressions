You will often make mistakes when writing code. You will soon get used to these, but here is how to interpret them.

Take a look at the code on the left. This shows a simple syntax error. 

Now press the button below to run the code and see the error.

{Run the code}(python3 run-user.py content/1-intro/error.py)

Once you have run the code, you will see the error appear.

## Interpreting the error
The error looks pretty unfriendly but the important information is really what comes first.

```
name 'digit4' is not defined
```

You can see it is telling us that that the variable `digit4` is not yet defined.
