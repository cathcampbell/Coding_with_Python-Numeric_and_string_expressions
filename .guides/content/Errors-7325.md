You will often make mistakes when writing code. You will soon get used to this, what is important is developing the skill of learning how to understand the errors and then fix them (debugging).

Look at the code on the left. This code contains a simple syntax error. 

Now press the button below to run the code.

{Run the code}(python3 content/1-intro/error.py)

Once you have run the code, you will see the error appear.

## Understanding the error
The error looks quite unfriendly. However, if you read the error carefully and look back through your code, you should be able to work out what to do to fix it. Have a look at the explanation below.

This is the error message:

```
name 'digit4' is not defined
```

This error is telling us that that the variable `digit4` is not defined anywhere in our code although we have tried to use it.
