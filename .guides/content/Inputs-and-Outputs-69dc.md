The way you handle inputs and outputs is very similar to Flode. 

{Run the code on the left}(python3 run-user.py content/1-intro/io-debug.py 3 4 5)

## Inputs
You will get input for your code from the command line. Python makes this easy by providing access to the command line arguments like this:

```python
digit1 = int(sys.argv[2])
digit2 = int(sys.argv[3])
digit3 = int(sys.argv[4])
```
You will learn more about how this works later. For now, we will provide this for you.

## Outputs
To output data, use the `print()` function as shown on the left.
