You are now ready to start writing real code using Python.

This course is also available in JavaScript and Java.

If you have more time, you could learn a second or third language. If you decide to do this the best approach is to work through one course first. Once you have completed the course, you will find it much easier to work through the course again using another language. You should also be able to work much more quickly the second and third time around!
