The way you handle inputs and outputs is very similar to Flode. We also offer a way to run and debug your code before assessing it through a challenge's "Check it!" button.

{Run the code on the left}(python3 run-user.py 1-intro/io-debug.py)

## Inputs
The coding challenges you will face will require your programs to accept various inputs. 

In our code on the left, `input0 = input0(3)` sets a value of `3` for `input0`. You can change the value `3` to anything you like when testing your code. The same applies to all other input values. 

Please be sure to use this format for all inputs.

## Debug (print) statements
To write debug information that is shown to you when your program runs, use the `print()` function, which can be supplied with any Python expression.

## Outputs
To output data for challenge assessments, use the `output()` function as shown on the left. This can contain any valid Python expression. If you want to output data to the console for debugging purposes, use the `print()` function instead.
