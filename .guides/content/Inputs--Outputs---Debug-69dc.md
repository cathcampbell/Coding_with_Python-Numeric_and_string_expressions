The way you handle inputs and outputs is very similar to Flode. We also offer a way to run and debug your code before assessing it through a challenge's "Check it!" button.

{Run the code on the left}(python run-user.py 1-intro/io-debug.py)

## Inputs
The coding challenges you will face will require your programs to take in various inputs. You can do this by calling the provided input functions `input0`, `input1`, `input2` etc. They are numbered, starting at 0 and go up to the amount required for the challenge. The input functions expect a default value, something that makes sense for debugging your code, but when your code is checked by the assessment system these functions will return random values to make sure your code handles many scenarious.

## Debug statements
To write debug information that is shown to you when your program runs, use the `print` keyword and put any Python expression afterwards.

## Outputs
To output data, use the `output()` function as shown on the left. This can contain any valid Python expressions. Normally all output is done using the print keyword but we wanted a way to seperate things displayed for debugging purposes and things displayed that need to be assessed in challenges.
