We are now ready to introduce you to writing real code using Python. 

This course is also available in Javascript and Java. All these languages will allow you to write real world applications but Javascript is the de facto programming language for front end web development.

For those with more time available, you could learn a second or third language. If you decide to do this then the best approach is to work through one course and then go through the other courses using the other languages. You will find that they will be much quicker than the first.
