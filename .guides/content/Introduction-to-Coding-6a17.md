We are now ready to introduce you to writing real code using Python. 

This course is also available in Javascript. Both languages will allow you to write real world applications but Javascript is the defacto programming language for frontend web development.

For those with more time available, you could learn both. If you take this approach then the best approach is to work through this module using one language first and go through it again using the other language. You will find that the second pass will be much quicker than the first.
